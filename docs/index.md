# Welcome
Hello! I’m TJ, a Engineering student . I chose the University of Guelph for its hands-on engineering curriculum, where each year includes industry-relevant design projects that build essential skills and connections.

On November 4th, I embarked on a major update to my website to create a portfolio that documents my journey as a Computer Engineering student. While some sections are still under construction, the site is a living document where you can explore the continuous development of my skills and projects. Each update captures my growth as an engineer and is designed to provide a clear and dynamic view of my work.

# Interests
My **technology interests** centers around designing communication systems and power management for data centers, especially regarding efficient, sustainable support for AI applications. I believe that well-designed data center infrastructure is essential for advancing modern technology.

My **research interests** as an undergraduate span both software applications and the hardware aspects of the electromagnetic spectrum using electrical engineering techniques. I am passionate about creating impactful projects that merge technical depth with innovative thinking.

Currently, I’m active in two student clubs where I apply my technical skills to real-world challenges. In Gryphon Aerospace, I contribute to the design of a Printed Circuit Board using Cadence OrCAD and Altium Designer. For the Creative Collaborative Collective at the University of Guelph, I’m part of a team developing a dynamic website using React and Node.js, along with a MongoDB database for an interactive bookshelf project.

I believe that great engineering design is rooted in collaboration, project management, and teamwork. I am dedicated to working alongside others from the conception of an idea through to final manufacturing, ensuring that designs remain practical, purposeful, and user-friendly. My expanding knowledge fuels my commitment to designing solutions for educational and commercial applications, spanning software development, system design, visible light communication engineering, and Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design.

Before attending the University of Guelph, I earned an Honours Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) in **Mathematics and Statistics** from McMaster University, where my studies focused on Data Science, Data Visualization, Machine Learning, and Computational Statistics with R, along with Mathematical Modelling using C and Python. Additionally, I mentored first-year students in science, mathematics, and business.

At the University of Guelph, I’m working towards achieving my professional engineering (P.Eng) designation in Ontario and Alberta, with the goal of becoming a recognized Canadian researcher in electrical and computer engineering, all while expanding my network and industry experience.

Feel free to send me a message on [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/t-j-prescod-heath/)  I am always open to chat and connect, simply send me a note, and we can easily have a virtual coffee and discuss our common interest. I always enjoy sharing my experience and providing meaningful solutions!
