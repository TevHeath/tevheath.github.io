#My Choice

Currently, I am using the **JetBrains** as a tool to improve my coding development. These include the following IDE such as Pycharm and CLion. Although, the IDE does not matter at the moment, ensuring that as developers you choose one to assist in developing and learning how to code is vital. Instead of simply picking the right IDE, just choose one and learn to program and make an adjust as you see fit.

Additionally, I choose to use JetBrains products was largely due to the easy method of incorporating GitHub in the various code projects. GitHub remains as a tool that I recognized was useful for me to learn as I develop as an engineering especially in the field of Software Engineering.
